https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/built-in-data-structures-25#/12      //Array & Object Complexity

Ques: return n*(n+1)/2    //O(1)

Ques: for(int i=0;i<n;i++){}   //O(n)


Ques : for(int i=0;i<n;i++)   //O(n^2)
	{
  	  for(int j=0;j<n;j++){}
	}


...Logarithms
log2(value) =exponent  

log2(8) =3   =>  2^exponent = value    (2^3 =8)

note: log2(2) =1


Ques: If you want to run the Loop minimum for 5(constant) times use
for(var i=1;i<Math.max(5,n);i++){ }

Ques: If you want to run the Loop maximum for 5(constant) times use
for(var i=1;i<Math.min(5,n);i++){ }

Ques: If you have lot of space but very less time?  //Recursion can be good in that case

Ques: How O(logn) is very less ?
O(logn) roughly gives no of times divide by 2.



.......................Topic : Problems Solving Approach.....................

slides   
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/problem-solving-patterns#/1/0/2

...Some Commonly Use approaches

FrequencyCounter - create object which has key value pair and then compare & remove
Multiple PointerPattern - use 2 or more pointer to traverse through array or linked list to solve problem 
			   for minimal space complexity
Siding Window - just slide and remove start and add end (ex- count sum of consective n digit no.)
Divide&Conquer - split code in small pieces (ex- binary search half the search array on each iteration)
DynamicProgramming - you can use an array which stores repetitive computation
Greedy Algorithm -
Backtracking -

Note: Check empty And Invalid Inputs while u solve algorithmic questions...

...LINEAR SEARCH
use when data is not sorted
O(n)

...BINARYSEARCH
use only when data is sorted
O(logn)
   
...KMP Algo

...BUBBLE SORT
slides-
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/elementary-sorting-algorithms    //notes slide

https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms   
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
https://visualgo.net/en/sorting?slide=1

works good if data is almost sorted
O(n2)

...SELECTION SORT
slide - see bubble sort( same) 
O(n2)
Use when u dont want much swap otherwise use bubblesort which is more efficient than selection

...INSERTIONSORT

O(n2)

...MERGESORT     //It is Comparison Sort
slide
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/intermediate-sorting-algorithms  //notes slide




...QuickSort     //It is Comparison Sort
worst case when array is already sorted [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8];
find a pivot which reduces the execution time(use median,or any random pivot)

O(n2) - when array is already sorted
Otherwise O(nlogn)

Ques: Quicksort vs MergeSort
	QuickSort		||		MergeSort
1.No auxillary Space Needed		1.Auxilliary space is needed
2.worst case could be O(n2)		2.Worst case remains same as Averagecase o(nlogn)
3.Not work good with large datset	3.can work good on large datasets
4.Work better than Merge on small	4.Work less better than quicksort on smalldataset
  datasets
5.Quicksort exhibits good cache	5.It occuppies extra space so not good for virtual memory environment
 locality and this makes quicksort	   i.e why good for linked list(extra memory head)
 faster than merge sort
 (in many cases like in virtual 
 memory environment).	
 i.e why good for arrays(no extra 
 memory head)

...RadixSort  

It is not a comparison sort
It is only for number

...Singly Linked list
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/singly-linked-lists

Important :	Stairs in building is a real life ex (RLE) of Linked List
		Elevator in building is a RLE of Array(or index based DS)

...DoublyLinkedList

...Stack & Queue (LIFO & FIFO) 
(Push Pop)  & (enqueue dequeue)

https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/stacks
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/queues

Ques: which is best to create stack from javascript shift unshift or push pop in Array Impl?
Ans: Push pop why? coz no shifting or no reindexing


Stack Real lIfe example..
stackof plate
multistorey building
icecream parlour cone


Queue real life example...
Background task in computer
waiting fo game to join
printer print using queue
frisking in airport and Metro

Array Stack impl - push(O1) & pop (O1)  || unshift(On) & shift (On)
Array Queue impl - push & shift  || unshift & pop (Both r not ideal as shift and unshift are not O1)


Pending stack and queue impl using array

...Trees
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/trees

Real Life Example...
	1.HTML Dom
	2.Network Routing
	3.Folders in Operating Systems
	4.Computer File Sysytem
	5.Json Object


Ques: When Tree is not good to use? //when  u have only one side tree 	

Ques: When to use Inorder,preorder,postorder?
Inorder :- gives in sorted order 
Preorder :- when u want to flatten it or remake it to tree [root left right root left right...]



........Heap
https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/heaps

MaxHeap MinHeap

Heap Using Array/List
child 2n+1,2n+2
parent floored ((n-1)/2)

To make heap correct use Bubbling up
