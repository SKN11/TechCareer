Ques: What is csrf.disable() ?   //Cross Site Request Forgery
Our recommendation is to use CSRF protection for any request that could be processed by a browser by normal users. If you are only creating a service that is used by non-browser clients, you will likely want to disable CSRF protection. 

Ques: What is csrf token?
When a CSRF token is generated, it should be stored server-side within the user's session data. When a subsequent request is received that requires validation, the server-side application should verify that the request includes a token which matches the value that was stored in the user's session. This validation must be performed regardless of the HTTP method or content type of the request. If the request does not contain any token at all, it should be rejected in the same way as when an invalid token is present.


Ques: What is Scalability in Application?
A scalable web application is a website that is able to handle an increase in users and load, whether in terms of a gradual or abrupt surge, without disrupting end-users' activities.

Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers 

Ques: How to thread safe a method without using synchronization keyword?
1. by making a method mutable


Ques: Explain ACID ?

	Atomicity: It defined all work in unit time .This effectively means that either we perform all the changes or none of them.

	Consistency: Whatever changes we want to do has to be done before transaction starts.

	In another way, Consistency ensures that we execute all the data changes while maintaining a consistent state at the start and the end of 	a transaction. 

	Isolation: Isolation ensures that we keep the intermediate states of a transaction invisible to other transactions.

	Durability: Durability ensures that when a transaction completes, we persist changes to the data


Ques: What is stateless and statefull server? //Rest is stateless

In Stateless, server is not needed to keep the server information or session details to itself.

In stateful, a server is required to maintain the current state and session information.

Ques: What is weaving?
Weaving is a process of linking aspect with other application.


Ques: Spring IOC Shutdown hook ? //registershutdownhook is used as addshutdownhook(Java Runtime Method) on The IOC container

Ques: Where to store password in character[] or String?
Strings are immutable there is no way the contents of Strings can be changed because any change will produce a new String, while if you use a char[] you can still set all the elements as blank or zero. So storing a password in a character array clearly mitigates the security risk of stealing a password.

String stays in the string pool until the garbage is collected anyone having the memory-dump can extract the password as clear text.
Using CharArray allows us to set it to blank whenever we are done with the password.

Ques: when u do deserialization how u can handle singleton object coz deserialization create new instance of object?
readResolve is used for replacing the object read from the stream. The only use I've ever seen for this is enforcing singletons; when an object is read, replace it with the singleton instance. This ensures that nobody can create another instance by serializing and deserializing the singleton.


Ques: where have u used protoptype in your program?

Ques: How did you intercept the request in your application?

To work with interceptor, you need to create @Component class that supports it and it should implement the HandlerInterceptor interface.

preHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the request to the controller.

postHandle() method − This is used to perform operations before sending the response to the client.

afterCompletion() method − This is used to perform operations after completing the request and response
