all datacentre(3 to 6) are separated geographically (to save from disaster) with high bandwidth and ultra low latency
For Low Latency choose availibilty zone which is near to you

Note: Availablity Zones(AZ) start from 2 but choose which has 3 AZ

........AWS Service
EC2 -  location based
IAM - global service(no region in init)

RegionTable- tells what service is avaialble where


.........IAM(Identity Access Management)

It is a service of aws used to manage users and their level of access to the aws management console.

what is least priviige principle ? //to give very less access to user
Never use root as an IAM credentials

OneIAM user per person
OneIAM role per applictaion

Create user -> mangeruser+createuser+add + access type (ex: console access, cli)
Create Security -> give all the security it needed(passwrdpolicy,group rules,delete root access key etc)


............EC2
renting vm(EC2)
storing data on vd(viryual drive)(EBS)
distribute loads(ELB)
autoscaling group(ASG)

AMI-Amazon Machine Image

Instance type(Total step 7)- create instance type memory cpu storage security etc of the vm.... 
I used once t2.micro

SSH-secureShell - commuinacate to ur remote ec2 machine using ssh
//if not SSH supported- alternative EC2InstanceCOnnect


Connect Your Laptop to EC2 VM
1. ssh -i file.pem ec2-user@ip_address      //file.pem is the key file (to secure it use 'chmod command')

2.whoami //ec-2user use to check who is the user

SecurityGroups - Inbound Outbound Tag ....it is for security for connection b/w ur machine and ec2 vm machine

Rules.....
Inbound - vm  can access who
Outbound - remotely who can access( port )
Tag -  

--------------------

Ques: What cloud service u use in your company?
IAM
EC2
S3
Lambda

Outscale Based
ServiceDefinition.xml -> requirement ex volume, security ,roles etc
cmd -> 
create ws
attch fws + serviceDefinition.xml
cloudbuild
---
Ques: AWS lambda....
loging
just need to focus on code and dependnecy
auto server installed
scaling based on incoming request
support lot of language

While using Lambda, you don't have to worry about scaling, patching, operating systems, etc.

----

s3:
It is object-based storage
bucket+object(dir+files)
bucket name dependent geolocation region(cannot create copy)
----

messaging- sns, sqs //producer consumer queue bus

messageque is used to connect two microservices

---

monitoring- amazon cloud watch service -
ds- supervision - create at a time when we create ec2 instance
---

what to study?
loadbalancer
scalability
