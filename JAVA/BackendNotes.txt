...........Annotations...

@RestController //Specifies it is controller

@RequestMapping("/api") //map request

@GetMapping(path="/contact-bean/{name}") //map get request means require some info

@PostMapping //maps update info 


@PathVariable //  ex : getPathVariable(@PathVariable String name->to get variable in uri also called path variable

@RequestBody // The @RequestBody annotation maps body of the web request to the method parameter

@RequestHeader /Annotation which indicates that a method parameter should be bound to a web request header

@Configuration //
Indicates that a class declares one or more @Bean methods andmay be processed by the Spring container to generate bean definitions andservice requests 
for those beans at runtime, for example: 
 @Configuration
 public class AppConfig {

     @Bean
     public MyBean myBean() {
         // instantiate, configure and return bean ...
     }
 }
