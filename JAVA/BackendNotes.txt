...........Topic1 : Spring..............

Ques : Why Spring? F Lw Lc
Well firstly it helps to do development faster,
reduces boilet plate code and
supports various application like JDBC,ORM,IOC,AOP,DAO,MVC,Security by predefined templates
It is a lightweight fw 
		//that means you can use its application individually as well
		for ex: you can use Spring JDBC without Spring MVC
Loose coupling //It gives good support for IoC and Dependency Injection results in loose coupling


Ques : What is IOC ? Reduces Tight coupling

Ques : But how ? IOC Container(Spring Container) responsible to inject dependency only we need to provide metadata via XML or ANootation

Ques : How many IOC Container ? //both are interfaces
Ans : Bean Factory 
	->BeanFactory factory=new XmlBeanFactory(resource);   //interface = implementation class
	->Student student=(Student)factory.getBean("studentbean");
      ApplicationContext
      	-> ApplicationContext context =new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("applicationContext.xml");   //interface = implementation class
      	
Ques :  It is better to use ApplicationContext than BeanFactory why?
Ans : built on top of the BeanFactory interface
      simple integration with Spring's AOP,
      message resource handling (for I18N),
      event propagation,
      application layer specific context (e.g. WebApplicationContext) for web application


Ques : What is application context?
The Application Context is Spring's advanced container. Similar to BeanFactory, it can load bean definitions, wire beans together, and dispense beans upon request


Ques : Why setter based DI is better than Constructorarg ? //Partial dependency , with contrctr new bean is created so setter is lightweight & flexible

Ques :Autowiring?

use for DI, internally uses setter or contructor, only reference can be initialized with autowiring
<bean id="b" class="org.sssit.B"></bean>  
<bean id="a" class="org.sssit.A" autowire="byName"></bean>  

autowire="byName" // bean id and bean name in class A must be same ex: B b;
autowire="byType" //it will not require same bean name but bean type should be unique ex: only one B b;
autowire="constructor" //autowire by constructor
autowire="no"  //no autowiring


Ques : Factory Method in Spring?

Static FM : give its own instance , internally uses singleton pattren
Static FM which gives instance of another class
<bean id="a" class="com.javatpoint.A" factory-method="getA"></bean>  

Non Static FM which gives instance of another class
<bean id="pfactory" class="com.javatpoint.PrintableFactory"></bean>   //coz factory is now non static

<bean id="p" class="com.javatpoint.PrintableFactory" factory-method="getPrintable"  factory-bean="pfactory"></bean> 


Ques :Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) ?  //Implemented by "Spring AspectJ AOP"

used to increase modularity by cross-cutting concerns.
A cross-cutting concern is a concern that can affect the whole application and should be centralized in one location in code as possible, such as transaction management, authentication, logging, security etc

JoinPoint : Method Executon, Spring supports only method execution join point.
Advice: what you need to do along joinpoint //@Before  , @After (before return) ,@AfterReturn (afterreturn) ,@Around @AfterThrowing
PointCut : expression language of AOP  //@Pointcut
Aspect : It is a class that contains advices, joinpoints etc.  //@Aspect
Weaving : Process of linking aspect with other application types or objects to create an advised object


Ques : Spring withORM?
Spring provides " API " to easily integrate Spring with ORM frameworks such as Hibernate, JPA(Java Persistence API) ?

Advantages :-
Less code //don't need to write such as getting the connection, starting transaction, commiting transaction, closing connection etc
Integrated transaction management
better exception handling



Ques : SPEL 
use to write expression within string 
also use to set value of bean object
parser.parseExpression("number").setValue(context,"5");  


...............Topic : Spring Security........................

It targets two areas 
authenticaion  //to know who is the user
authorization   //to give permission

OAuth 2.0 Login //facility to the user to login into the application by using their existing account at GitHub or Google.

..........Topic : Spring MVC Validation...............

(@Valid @ModelAttribute("emp")Employee emp,BindingResult r) in request handling method in controller

@Size(min=1,message="required") in pojo datavariable
private String pass; 

@Pattern(regexp="^[a-zA-Z0-9]{3}",message="length must be 3")  
private String pass; 

@Min(value=18, message="must be equal or greater than 18")  
@Max(value=45, message="must be equal or less than 45")  
private int age;  
	
	
CUSTOM VALIDATION 
we can create custoem validation using
public @interface CustomPassword



...........Topic : RestFul WebServices..............

What is Webservice?
It is way to communicate between two devices or network
For Ex :Java application can interact with Java, .Net, and PHP
Use:if your client uses PHP as thier technology and wants some list from you which u have written in java so with the help of webservice
it can be easily possible

What is Remote Prodedure Call or RPC
In distributed computing, a remote procedure call is when a computer program causes a procedure to execute in a different address space,
 which is coded as if it were a normal procedure call.
 
 SOAP Simple Object Access protocol
 REST Representational state Transfer
 
Ques : What is JAXWS & JAXRS?
 JAX-WS is the java API specification for SOAP web services. Implemented by RPC Style OR Document style
 JAX-RS is the java API specification for RESTful web services.  Implementor Jersey & RestEasy
 
 **** REST permits different data such as PlainText,HTML,XML,Json whereas SOAP only permits XML

What is service?
A service is a well-defined, self-contained logical function that represents a unit of functionality.
For ex: TCS tcs is a compony that provides services to their clients also interact with other Companies(other service) to get the task done
