............String................
Ques : What happen if you pass string as parameter to method which changes the sring?
Refer -> https://theopentutorials.com/tutorials/java/strings/passing-string-as-parameter-to-a-method/

Ques : String s1 = "geeksquiz";
       String s2 = "geeksquiz";
       System.out.println("s1 == s2 is:" + s1 == s2);  //+ is more precednce than == o/p is "s1 == s2 is: + geeksquiz == geeksquiz"
        
Ques : System.out.println(10  +  20 + "GeeksQuiz");  //30GeeksQuiz
       System.out.println("GeeksQuiz" + 10 + 20);   //GeeksQuiz1020




...............Thread.................
Ques 1:What start() method does? //instantiate,allocates CPU

Ques 2:What is Thread Scheduler?  // allocates CPU

Ques 3:Does run method of thread class can have arguments?  //public void run(){}

Ques 4:Which method is useful to create Thread, extending thread or implementing runnable interface?   //implementing runnable

Ques 5:Thread Deadlock startegy?   //Thread.currentThread().join() or put join on each other thread

Ques 6: How Synchronized Block is better approach then Synchronised Method? // The main advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method is it reduces waiting time of Thread and improves performance of the system

............Java8Features..........
Ques 1:What is Lambda Expression? 
()-> {}
use to implement functional interface And Less Code(ex apllying for each on list etc)

Ques 2:What is Method Reference
Ans : By Static =  ClassName::MethodName;
By Insatnce Method = InstnceObject::MethodName;
By Constructor = className::new;

Ques 3:What is Functional Interface 
which only has one abstract method
can have object class method
can have default mathod
@FunctionalInterface

Ques 4: Java Stream
It is functional in nature and lazy and evaluates code when only it requires
List<Float> productPriceList2 =productsList.stream()  
                                     .filter(p -> p.price > 30000)// filtering data  
                                     .map(p->p.price)        // fetching price  
                                     .collect(Collectors.toList()); // collecting as list  
                                     
Stream.iterate(1, element->element+1)  

long count = productsList.stream()  
                    .filter(product->product.price<30000)  
                    .count();  
                    
convert Set To List
 .collect(Collectors.toSet());

convert List Into Map
productsList.stream().collect(Collectors.toMap(p->p.id, p->p.name));                         

Ques 5:what is Base64 Encoding and Decoding?
Ans : Use to encode decode message url etc.

Ques 6: Default method in interface
Ans :  yes we can create default method in a java8 interface also we can make static method in an interface
but still abstarct class and interface are diffrent as we can not create constructor in an interface whereas we can make that in abstarct class


Ques 7: StringJoiner
StringJoiner joinNames = new StringJoiner(",", "[", "]");   // passing comma(,) and square-brackets as delimiter   
        joinNames.add("Rahul");  
        joinNames.add("Raju");  
        joinNames.add("Peter");  
        joinNames.add("Raheem");  
        System.out.println(joinNames);   // [Rahul,Raju,Peter,Raheem]

Ques 8: For Each in java8
 gamesList.forEach(games -> System.out.println(games)); 
 
 
Ques9: Optional Class
Optional<String> checkNull = Optional.ofNullable(str[5]);  
        if(checkNull.isPresent()){  // check for value is present or not  
            String lowercaseString = str[5].toLowerCase();  
            System.out.print(lowercaseString);  
        }else  
            System.out.println("string value is not present"); 
            
          or
          
 Optional<String> checkNull = Optional.ofNullable(str[5]);  
        checkNull.ifPresent(System.out::println);   // printing value by using method reference  
        System.out.println(checkNull.get());    // printing value by using get method  
        
        
QUes10: Parallersort in array
Arrays.parallelSort(arr,0,4);  //0 is inclusive 4 is exclusive  , use for partial sorting
 Arrays.parallelSort(arr)
 
 Ques 11. What is Type Annotation?  //yet to learn
        


............General Question........
Ques 1:Why in a java class we cannot declare two public class?
A Java source file can have only one class declared as public, we cannot put two or more public classes together in
a . java file. This is because of the restriction that the file name should be same as the name of the public class with . java extension.

    }
    
Ques : What is >> & >>>operator ? //It is a right shift operator and The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand
