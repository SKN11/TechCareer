what is CallBacks?
Ex if you want to load a script and call a func that script has in it. If we call after load scriot it will throw error as may be script is not loaded
instead we use callbacks to call that function

...For Error handling
function loadScript(src, callback) {
  let script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = src;

  script.onload = () => callback(null, script);
  script.onerror = () => callback(new Error(`Script load error for ${src}`));

  document.head.append(script);
}

loadScript('/my/script.js', function(error, script) {  //error-first callback” style.
  if (error) {
    // handle error
  } else {
    // script loaded successfully
  }
});

Ques 2: What is Pyramid of doom in Javascript?
callbacks in callbacks........

Ques 3: What is Promise   //plz refere PromiseDemo.html in Javascript folder
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  // executor (the producing code, "singer")
});


The promise object returned by the new Promise constructor has these internal properties:

state — initially "pending", then changes to either "fulfilled" when resolve is called or "rejected" when reject is called.
result — initially undefined, then changes to value when resolve(value) called or error when reject(error) is called.

Ques 4 What is .then?
promise.then(
  function(result) { /* handle a successful result */ },
  function(error) { /* handle an error */ }
);
