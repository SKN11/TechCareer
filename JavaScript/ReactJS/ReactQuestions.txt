Ques1: What is the algorithm used in virtual dom?
Reconcilliation diff algorithm

Ques : What is Reconcilliation?
Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component's state changes, React has to calculate if it is necessary to update the DOM. It does this by creating a virtual DOM and comparing it with the current DOM. In this context, the virtual DOM will contain the new state of the component.
