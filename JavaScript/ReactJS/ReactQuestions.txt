Ques1: What is the algorithm used in virtual dom?
Reconcilliation diff algorithm

Ques : What is Reconcilliation?
Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component's state changes, React has to calculate if it is necessary to update the DOM. It does this by creating a virtual DOM and comparing it with the current DOM. In this context, the virtual DOM will contain the new state of the component.

Ques: If you want to pass some data from child componenet to parent ?
<li key={ig.id} onClick={props.onRemoveItem.bind(this, ig.id)}>

Ques: What is event.preventDefault(); does ?

OR

Ques: React.memo and useMemo ?
First is use to memoize component and second is react hooks use to memoize functional component 

Ques: {props.loading && <LoadingIndicator/>} is same as  {props.loading ? <LoadingIndicator/> : null}

Ques: What are the rules which is checked by ReactHook interally?(for predefined & custom both)
Rule 1-
Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function
But Why? It allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls.

Rule 2-
Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:
✅ Call Hooks from React function components.
✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks

Ques: Rules for creating custom hooks?
1. Always start it with useCustomHook.

Ques: Accessing React State right after setting it?
openAddBoardModal() {
        this.setState({ boardAddModalShow: true }); // set boardAddModalShow to true

        /* After setting a new state it still returns a false value */
        console.log(this.state.boardAddModalShow);   
    }
    
Your state needs some time to mutate, and since console.log(this.state.boardAddModalShow) executes before the state mutates, you get the previous value as output. So you need to write the console in the callback to the setState function like below...

openAddBoardModal() {
  this.setState({ boardAddModalShow: true }, function () {
    console.log(this.state.boardAddModalShow);
  });
}
