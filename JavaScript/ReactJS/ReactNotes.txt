Ques4: setInterval(Tick, 1000); is used for? //It is used to call function repeatedly with given time

Ques 6: What are pseudo selector?
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example,
 :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.

=======
Ques 6: //use this.setState only to change state if you use this.state.contact[0] ={} it wont work

Ques 7: this.setState merges the state that you give use State doesn't i.e it replaces

you can have as many useState as you want it gives you freedom to split up your big state object to small pieces of object

Ques 8 : Stateless Component are also called Presentational componenr or dumb components and it is best practice to use it as many as possible

Ques 9 : React Component Lifecycle hooks ( Nothing to do with react hooks)

constructor
\|/
getDerivedStatefromProps //if props changes update state
\|/
render()
\|/
Render Child Component
\|/
componenrDidMount // call your setstate after completion of http call in CDM Component
\|/


Component Life - Update

getDerivedStatefromProps
\|/
shouldComponentUpdate //permission for com
\|/
render()
\|/
UpdateChildComponent props
\|/
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
\|/
componentDidUpdate



useEffect is executed at every cycle of component also use for clean up activities

React.memo() // stores the snapshot of Component only rerender when its input changes otherwise no changes
				if any props passedto component chnagesthen only it render otherwise old copies
				
When should u not use react memo & ShouldComponentUpdate? //if we know coz of parent child component changes then dont wrap it in these two techniques 
which run unneccessary code while executing

What is PureComponent?

no need to use shouldComponentUpdate if you are checking for all properties extends it with PureComponent
