React Ques...

Ques 1) What is package.json file?
It is file in which dependencies are declared

Ques 2) What is export defaut

A module is a self contained unit that can expose assets to other modules using export, and acquire assets from other modules using import.


Ques3: In function onClick={()=>props.onClick} dont work instead use onClick={props.onClick}


Ques4: setInterval(Tick, 1000); is used for? //It is used to call function repeatedly with given time

Ques 5: react is not inheritence type startegy it is composition type startegy

Ques 6: What are pseudo selector?
A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example,
 :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.
 https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes

Ques 6: //use this.setState only to change state if you use this.state.contact[0] ={} it wont work

Ques 7: this.setState merges the state that you give useState doesn't i.e it replaces

you can have as many useState as you want it gives you freedom to split up your big state object to small pieces of object

Ques 8 : Stateless Component are also called Presentational component or dumb components and it is best practice to use it as many as possible

Ques 9 : React Component Lifecycle hooks ( Nothing to do with react hooks)

constructor
\|/
getDerivedStatefromProps //if props changes update state
\|/
render()
\|/
Render Child Component
\|/
componenrDidMount // call your setstate after completion of http call in CDM Component
\|/


Component Life - Update

getDerivedStatefromProps
\|/
shouldComponentUpdate //permission for com
\|/
render()
\|/
UpdateChildComponent props
\|/
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
\|/
componentDidUpdate //called when props and state updates




useEffect is executed at every cycle of component also use for clean up activities or after all rendering done

React.memo() // stores the snapshot of Component only rerender when its input changes otherwise no changes
				if any props passedto component chnages then only it render otherwise old copies
				
When should u not use react memo & ShouldComponentUpdate? //if we know coz of parent child component changes then dont wrap it in these two techniques 
which run unneccessary code while executing

Ques : What is PureComponent?
Pure Components in React are the components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been updated with the same values.If the value of the previous state or props and the new state or props is the same, the component is not re-rendered.


Ques : What are higher order component
Ques : What are propTypes
Ques : cssfilename.module.css in order to run it without npm run eject

.................Topic: React Routing...................
To install in your app 
npm install -save react-router react-router-dom  //install router

Routing...
wrap App.js in BrowserRouter component

Redirect...
can be used with Switch or can be used directly but without switch u cannot use from u can only use to props

Guards...
{this.state.auth ? <Route path='/new-post'  component={NewPost} : null />}

Handle 404 case using Route without path...
<Route render={()=> <h1>Not found 404</h1>}/>

Lazy Route loading...

this.props.history.push('/checkout'); //pushes checkout page into the current page thus it allows us to switch the page on stack of pages

ReactFragment.....
<ReactFragment> react inbuild hoc

Ques:What is this.props.history ?

.....................Topic: send Data via Query Param...........
const queryParams = [];
        for(let i in this.state.ingredients)
        {
            queryParams.push(encodeURIComponent(i)+'='+encodeURIComponent(this.state.ingredients[i]))
        }
        console.log(this.props.history);
        const query = queryParams.join('&');
        this.props.history.push({
            pathname:'/checkout',
            search:'?'+query
            
        });
        
 Reading via query Param...........
 
  const queryParam = new URLSearchParams(this.props.location.search);
        console.log(queryParam);
        const ingredient = {};
        for(let param of  queryParam.entries())
        {
            ingredient[param[0]] = parseInt(param[1]);
        }


.............Topic: React Authentication...........

Why Token not stored in redux state ? //coz if somebody reloads SPA then all thing gone so it is stored in client side local storag
React









.............Topic: Unit Test...........

We make first unit test and then start development. 
Intially it fails but as application code done it runs successfully

It is possible that in First Draft all unit test are passing but if any new feature comes some unit test are failing.

What to test
Dont test library
Dont test complex connection
Do Test isolated unit ex conditional output,components,check various o/p on various conditions 


Enzyme
It allows us to just render this navigation items component standalone independent of the entire react application
enzyme need adapter to connect with react
shallow function -render the component but replaces as placeholder

Installation.....
npm install --save enzyme react-test-render enzyme-adapter-react-16    //yarn add
react-test-render - depenedncy that enzyme needed
enzyme-adapter-react-16 - t connect enzyme with react app

describe()-defines test suites
it() defines individual test for a component in react



.............Topic: WebPack...........
Basically Webpack use for large full stack app but if u have small app or single page app u can use create-react-app


webpack is use to bundle different file together 
ex: bundle.js  bundle.css

webpack neeed entry point for bundling after that it automatically reads import statement and bundle the various files together

Basic Workflow requirements
Compile NextGen Javascript Feautures
Handle JSX
CSS Autoprefixing
Support Image Imports
Optimize Code
.................all done by loader in webpack

npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-dev-server
npm install --save-dev webpack-cli


In Package.json in scripts

"start":"webpack-dev-server"   -- tells npm to execute and start building our files


Wee need to tell webpack entry point in our project  //entry: './src/index.js'
Also need to tell output for generated output
devtool:'cheap-module-eval-source-map' - use for debugging the original code rather than bundle code

--------
mode:"developement" or mode: "production"
It tells server wheather apply some optimization or not for ex in development mode it applies less shrinking which helps to debug
but apply more optimization and shrinking for production

Read webpack.config to understand full use of webpack in project

Question yet to answer

Ques:How to handle onclick event in child component by passing a value id?
